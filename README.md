To use the bot, you need to have your fishing rod equipped.

I recommend that the water source be at least 3 blocks in height to ensure it works 100%. The water source must be in front of you, not behind, or it wonâ€™t work!

You also need to be positioned at the top left corner of the block. To achieve this, place a wall to your left and ensure that the water source is in front of you. This setup will help you be in the top left corner of the block you are standing on.

The bot should work with any screen resolution. It will automatically catch fish and other items from the fishing minigame for you.
